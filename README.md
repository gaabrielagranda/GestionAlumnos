# Student Management System

## Overview

This is a simple **Student Management System** implemented in **Java**. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on student records, including:

- Add a new student.
- View all students.
- Edit an existing student's details.
- Delete a student by index.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Allows the user to input and save the details of a student, including name, surname, phone number, email, grades, attendance, and final grades.
- **View Students**: Displays a list of all students with their details.
- **Edit Student**: Modify an existing student's details (name, surname, phone, email, grades, attendance, etc.).
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student record by providing the student's index in the list.
- **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The program is built using standard Java libraries, including `java.util.Scanner`.
- **Classes**: The program uses a `GestorAlumno` class for managing student operations (add, update, remove, view), and an `Alumno` class to represent each student with their attributes.
